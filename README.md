# Akan-name-DOB
It is a good thing when babies are born.The Akan people of Ghana, name babies based on the days of birth and gender. E.g, if a baby boy is born on Saturday, he is named Kwame.This project helps us feel closer to the Ghanians by supplying Akan names. One is required to input Date Of Birth and upon submission, Akan name is displayed.
